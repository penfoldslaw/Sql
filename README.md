# Cottage Rental
This is a SQL script that creates tables for a vacation rental management system. The tables include information on regions, cottages, prices, customers, bookings, and payments. The script also includes a way to import data from CSV files for the cottages, prices and customers tables. This script can be useful for those creating a database for a vacation rental management system or for examples of creating tables with foreign keys and importing data.

# Filtering with Sql
In this project, I utilized the Northwind database in SQL to perform various data analysis and manipulation tasks. I first connected to the database using SQL Server Management Studio and wrote SQL queries to extract relevant information from the tables. I then used this information to create visualizations and perform calculations to answer specific business questions. For example, I used data from the 'Orders' and 'Order Details' tables to analyze sales by category and by country, and I used data from the 'Employees' and 'Territories' tables to analyze employee performance by region. I also implemented several stored procedures to update and manipulate the data in the database, such as updating product prices or creating a new customer. Overall, the Northwind database served as a valuable tool for gaining insights into the inner workings of a fictional company and allowed me to practice my SQL skills.
